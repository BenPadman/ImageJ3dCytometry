# ImageJ3dCytometry

Imagej/FIJI scripts required to conduct Object-Based Image Analysis for automatic quantitative 3D analysis of autophagic foci and their autophagic substrates during PINK1/Parkin mitophagy. The scripts use multi-channel 3D confocal datasets acquired from immunofluorescence samples to segment and extract 3D ROIs, measure them in each channel, then store the data for subsequent numerical analysis.

The provided scripts are to be used in conjunction with the method outlined by Benjamin S. Padman & Michael Lazarou in <INSERT METHOD CHAPTER DOI> published in <INSERT YEAR>
