# ImageJ3dCytometry

Imagej/FIJI scripts required to conduct Object-Based Image Analysis for automatic quantitative 3D analysis of autophagic foci and their autophagic substrates during PINK1/Parkin mitophagy. The scripts use multi-channel 3D confocal datasets acquired from immunofluorescence samples to segment and extract 3D ROIs, measure them in each channel, then store the data for subsequent numerical analysis.
